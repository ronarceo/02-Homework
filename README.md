# Advanced CSS: Portfolio

I made my portfolio using html and css and added features based on the given acceptance criteria.

Features:
```
Portfolio contains my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, future projects, and my contact information.
Navigation bar allows UI to scroll to each corresponding section.
First application's image made larger in size than the others.
Images of applications set up with <a> tags to be updated in the future to link to future projects. 
Media query added to allow the site to be viewed on various screens and devices that adapts to my viewport.
```
